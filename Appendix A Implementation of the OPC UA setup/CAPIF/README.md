# CAPIF using scripts

The JavaScript codes communicate with OpenCAPIF (open source implementation of Common API Framework) core services using HTTPS requests. They also communicate with OPC UA publisher/subscriber using Unix socket.
There are 2 main codes run by the main thread. They are for 2 roles allowed for users in CAPIF, which is the exposer/provider and the invoker.
The exposer exposes the provider machine's or service's internal API through CAPIF core services, which the invoker can discover and use to set shared internal variable through the API.
