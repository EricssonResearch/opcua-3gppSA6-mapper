 Python code using Connexion to emulate NRM server.
 Expects 3GPP API requests found in "/connexion-example-master/yaml/" folder.
 This example doesn't use authentication process only an access token, which is hard coded into the server.

 To run it use simply [ python3 Connexion.py ] command in terminal or use the Mininet test to run everything on an emulated network.
