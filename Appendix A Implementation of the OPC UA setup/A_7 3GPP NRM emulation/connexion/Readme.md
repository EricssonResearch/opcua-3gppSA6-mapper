 Python code using Connexion to emulate NRM server.
 Expects 3GPP API requests found in "/connexion-example-master/yaml/" folder.
 This example doesn't use authentication process only an access token, which is hard coded into the server.
 This is for testing and proof concept only.

 The NRM server will be using MySQL database server to store registered requests and their last state in case of a crash or sudden shutdown.
 It communicates with the Mininet controller UNIX socket server to set the bandwidth, delay, vlan setting of ues and communication links of the network emulated with Mininet.
 For testing purposes the delay will be set by either the cellid or geo location reported by user device.
 The new vlan id will be randomly generated by NRM server on changes with the group settings.
 The delay is set based on the calculated distance between devices, for noticible changes the delay will be much larger than it would be if end devices were that far.


 To run it use simply [ python3 Connexion.py ] command in terminal or use the Mininet test to run everything on an emulated network. 
 Currently implemented functions and APIs are: Group Management, Unicast- and Multicast-subscriptions (for unique QoS requests), Location Reporting Configuration and Location Area Info Retrieval. (Last is not uploaded yet.)
