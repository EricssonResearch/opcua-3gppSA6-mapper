 Here are the codes that are connected to the Service Enabled Architechture Layer, like the Topic Watcher. 
 
 The topic watcher monitors the changes in the bandwidth usage of topics, the publisher(s) and subscriber(s) connected to it.
 It creates and sends requests to the the SEAL server managing the network resources allowed to the communcation channels on the network.
 There is also the bandwidth monitoring code that runs on the provider machine, the 5-tuple collecting script running on the cloud server.

 The required other scripts will be uploaded here too.
