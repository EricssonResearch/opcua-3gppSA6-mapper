  abstract = {In the realm of Network Function Virtualization (NFV) and Software Defined Networking (SDN), the shift of network functions to the edge presents both challenges and opportunities across various industries. This paper investigates the utilization of Network Resource Management (NRM) within the Third Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) Service Enabler Architecture Layer (SEAL) framework for network operations in different sectors. Leveraging the Open Platform Communications (OPC) Unified Architecture (UA) Publish Subscribe (PubSub) pattern, we enhance edge networking by automating NRM within SEAL, introducing custom Message Queuing Telemetry Transport (MQTT) brokers and a mapping node. To validate our approach, we establish a SEAL NRM test server and implement a translator mechanism for interoperability. We address the integration of non-adaptive applications into the NRM domain and demonstrate our proposal with a practical Robot Operating System (ROS) Digital Twin (DT) application, showcasing dynamic NRM’s potential for optimizing network resources in scenarios like 3D printing.}
